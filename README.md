CA Term 1 Ruby Morning Challenges - Student Starter Repo

Students should fork and clone this repo to get and complete the morning challenges.

Once the fork is cloned locally, add this base repo as a new remote:

```sh
git remote add morning https://github.com/CoderAcademy-BRI/morning-challenges-term1.git
```

Then, each morning, get the new challenge with:

```sh
git pull morning master
```
